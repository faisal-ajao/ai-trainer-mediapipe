# AI Trainer with Mediapipe

This project implements an AI-powered fitness trainer using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.  
It uses pose detection to count exercise repetitions (like bicep curls) in real time and provides visual feedback.

---

## Features
- Real-time human pose detection with Mediapipe.
- Counts repetitions based on joint angles.
- Displays percentage progress bar and rep count.
- Smooth performance with optimized OpenCV rendering.
- Works with webcam input.

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/faisal-ajao/ai-trainer-mediapipe.git
cd ai-trainer-mediapipe

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\\Scripts\\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
